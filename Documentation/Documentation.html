    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>BuildCop is a tool that analyzes MSBuild project files (interactively or during e.g.
        a daily build) according to a customizable set of rules and generates reports -
        e.g. is strong naming enabled, are certain project properties set correctly, is
        XML documentation being generated, are assembly references correct, are naming conventions
        respected, ...</p>
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>BuildCop consists of a command-line tool and an XML configuration file. When the
        application is run, it will read the configuration file to figure out which files
        to analyze, which rules to run, and which reports to generate.</p>
    <p>Basic usage looks as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Define the configuration file:</b> this XML file determines the actions that
            BuildCop takes; see below for the details of the configuration file.</li>
        <li><b>Run the tool:</b> this can be done interactively on the command-line or in an
            automated way, e.g. during a daily build.</li>
        <li><b>Open the report(s):</b> the generated reports contain the results of the analysis
            and allow you to take appropriate actions to correct issues in MSBuild files; various
            reporting options (to the console, or to a XML, HTML or CSV file) are provided out
            of the box.</li>
        <li><b>Create additional rules and/or formatters:</b> BuildCop is created with extensibility
            in mind, so if you would like to extend BuildCop to run additional rules or provide
            additional reporting formats, it's quite easy to provide custom rules and formatters.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the future, an additional GUI application could be foreseen to run the rules interactively
        in a rich Windows application, and to edit configuration files, but those are currently
        not implemented yet. Of course, feel free to contact me if you want to contribute
        to the project!</p>
